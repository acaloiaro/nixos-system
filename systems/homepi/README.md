This system is not yet in its desired state. While it currently builds a working raspberrypi/kodi system, a few things 
are not ideal.

1. It's pinned to an arbitrary NixOS 23.05 version due to a confluence of bugs between home-manager, and hardware 
support for video acceleration and audio on raspberry pi.
